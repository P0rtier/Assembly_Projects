# Assembly_Projects

# Project 1
  First project was based on the implementation of basic arithmetical operations such as addition, multiplication and subtraction

# Project 2
  Second project was really an enhanced version of the 1st one, where I created and implemented a calculator that could perform basic operations.
  The numbers given to the calculator could've been  either integer or floating point with single / double precision. 
  Results of the chosen operations could be seen in the GDB.

# Project  3
  Third project involved a basic implementation of Flynn's taksonomy interpretation of data processing using single / multiple data streams SISD / SIMD.
  Project was executed in C++ with implementation of asm() functions where direct Assembly procedures were written.
